# HannahWebsite
This website is intended to be a portfolio and also an introduction to me and my projects, passions, and hobbies!

I made this website by teaching myself Blender and with the help of the following tutorial available on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxTb9ys834w&t=10440s&ab_channel=AndrewWoan

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - currently I have completed the modelling portion of this portfolio, and am now working to make it interactive!

I'm currently working through some kinks involved with hosting on GitHub - this readme will serve as documentation to show project progress.

# Progress Documentation
This project began sometime in February/March 2023 - I had been making steady progress learning Angular and UI/UX fundamentals. 
I came across the above video when a coworker showed it to me. The isometric room design intrigued me, and I had wanted to learn Blender (as I thoroughly enjoy 3D modelling).

Upon considering this project and where I wanted to take creative liberties with it - I decided to make this into a portfolio and include aspects of my personality that might not be traditionally seen as appropriate in a professional context..
This includes topics such as my taste in music, my love for video games, and my obsession with crochet and embroidery.

I began by outlining which topics were important for me to include in my portfolio and how to organize them. I then grouped these and decided upon representative objects to place around my virtual room.
An example of this would be the boxing gloves placed on the floor, representative of my love for Muay Thai.

Below is an initial mockup of the isometric room design on figma. This shows both a light and dark mode for the room.

I am especially proud of some minimalistic album covers I made to match the simplistic design of the room.

I built up the room on blender over the course of several weeks - making some small alterations to the original layout as I saw fit:

Finally we return to the present. I am still working on this project. I hope to finish it within the next few weeks, and to upload a more thorough explanation of the design process.

Below is a screenshot of the model as it appears on my localhost currently. Much work is left to do!
